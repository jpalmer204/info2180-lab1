        <p>[I am a very meticulous individual. I often obsess over anything I am interesting which more often than not  shifts over into my school work. 
            This charactertic has its positives when ut translates into assignments. One way in which it is a positive is that it pushes me to produce 
            quality work while a downside is it often leaves me fixated on a particular task until it is perfect disregarding any other task until the first was in completed]</p>
